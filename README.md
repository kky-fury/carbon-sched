# Carbon-Aware Scheduler
Aim of this work will be to propose and develop a scheduling policy for intelligent placement of serverless workloads in different regions depending on the availability of renewable resources at given point of time. To achieve this, we will exploit  kubernetes’ container orchestration capabilities and Knative’s capability of building serverless applications.
